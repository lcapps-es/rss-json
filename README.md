# rss-json
Converts RSS to JSON

## Install
```
composer install
```
You just have to use whatever webserver you like.

## How it works
You just have to call the url with the rss parameter pointing to a RSS source.  
It literally converts the RSS to JSON, so it depends on the format of the RSS/Atom to process the JSON.
